== README

A Rails app that collects and maps stories on how climate change affects the environment- natural and human- on a local scale.

I used the gmaps4rails gem, with help from this [great tutorial](http://andyglassblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/google-maps-for-rails-with-gmaps4-rails-tutorial-on-how-to-post-and-filter-locations/)

Created for the General Assembly WDI Boston 2013 first project.
